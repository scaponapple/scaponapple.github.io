title: SCAP on Apple
---

## Mission

{:.lead}
The SCAP on Apple open source project engages and empowers the SCAP community to strengthen the awareness, knowledge and collaboration on SCAP content, tools and solutions with authoritative data for the Apple platforms ([macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos/) and [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/)).


## Motivation

Managing patches and secure configurations of a large number of enterprise systems, while ensuring each one is compliant with security requirements, has become a daunting task for IT. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](http://scap.nist.gov) is leading the charge in defining the standards, developing the specifications, and guiding vendors in developing SCAP content and deploying compliant tools for all platforms.

* [Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Versions 1.2 (DRAFT)](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-117-R1/Draft-SP800-117-r1.pdf)
