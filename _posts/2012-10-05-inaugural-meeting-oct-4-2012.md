The inaugural meeting on October 4, 2012 at the [8th Annual IT Security Automation Conference](http://itsac.g2planet.com/itsac2012/) in Baltimore, MD, marked the launch of the **SCAP-On-Apple** Project here on MacOSForge.org.

The **SCAP-On-Apple** Project Team was very excited by the turnout yesterday with representatives from all sectors of the SCAP Community interested in immediately engaging in collaboration.

Those unable to attend in person will have plenty of opportunity to engage by jumping on the mailing lists and pulling our efforts together.

Much can be accomplished by like minded people with laser focus.
