The long wait is over! We are very excited to launch the **SCAP-On-Apple** Project here on MacOSForge.org simultaneously with the first community gathering at the [8th Annual IT Security Automation Conference](http://itsac.g2planet.com/itsac2012/) in Baltimore, MD - October 3-5, 2012.

### Mission

The **SCAP-On-Apple** Open Source Project engages and empowers the **SCAP** community to strengthen the awareness, knowledge and collaboration on **SCAP** Content, Tools and Solutions with authoritative data for the Apple Platforms [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx/) and [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/).

### Motivation

Managing patches and secure configurations of a large number of enterprise systems, while ensuring each one is compliant with security requirements, has become a daunting task for IT. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](http://csrc.nist.gov) is leading the charge in defining the standards, developing the specifications, and guiding the community in developing [SCAP](http://scap.nist.gov) content and deploying compliant tools for all platforms.

### Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Versions 1.2 (DRAFT)

[Special Publication 800-117 Revision 1 (DRAFT)](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/darfts/800-117-R1/Draft-SP800-117-r1.pdf)

### Resources

This Project's goal is to **augment** the existing SCAP Community efforts by focusing exclusively on relevant information for OSX and iOS. To facilitate the SCAP Community, the project will provide the following services hosted here under https://SCAP-On-Apple.MacOSForge.org/ :

* [Blog](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/news) for timely announcements and updates
* [Wiki](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/trac/wiki) for Information & Documentation
* [Source Repository](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/trac/browser) for Source Repository hosting and versioning
* [Mailing Lists](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/MailingList) for community sharing
* [Ticketing System](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/trac/newticket) for defects and enhancement submission and tracking

### Bug / Enhancement Ticket System

The Project Team encourages all participants to fully utilize the [Ticketing System](https://scap-on-apple.macosforge.org/trac/newticket) to identify, submit, and track defects and enhancement requests against all content (wiki, documentation, tools, source code, etc.) maintained by this project.
