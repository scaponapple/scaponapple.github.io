## Community Involvement

{:.lead}
This project is to engage and empower the SCAP community focusing on the Apple platforms. There are many ways that individuals and organizations can get involved and contribute.

### Everyone

Anyone personally or professionally involved in SCAP content and tools with a need to work directly with the Apple platforms ([macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos/) and [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/)) will want to engage in this project. Whether it is to jump in with both feet and fully engage or mingle with the community to learn more about what SCAP is, everyone will learn what it can do for them and their systems. The [blog]({{ '/news/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) will have frequent posts of activities and relevant updates for this community. The project web site will be the central location for all relevant project information, files and links.

### Large Enterprise (Commercial / Government) System Admins

Your active involvement with this project in reviewing, testing and submitting to shared SCAP content will ensure the tool community is meeting your needs for SCAP compliance. You will definitely want to join the SCAP on Apple [mailing list]({{ '/mailing-lists/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and dive in when you are ready.

### SCAP Tool and Vendor Community

Your active involvement with this project will ensure you are drawing from authoritative information on how best to implement test, gather system information and report accurate information with your tools. There is a developer-specific [mailing list]({{ '/mailing-lists/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) where low-level protocol and data handling questions will be most appropriate in asking and sharing with the rest of the community.

The [source repository](https://github.com/scaponapple/scaponapple) will host and version all submissions of source code and content relevant to the Apple platforms. You are encouraged to both contribute and consume from this central repository. This repository is not intended to replace existing repositories, but rather an augmentation with Apple platform relevant source. If you have any questions as to whether you should submit source (code/content) here or at another location within the SCAP community, do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:scap-contact@macosforge.org).

### Licensing

Please take some time to read and understand the Terms of Use and Licensing Terms when submitting or using content from the SCAP on Apple open source project.

## Bugs, Features and Enhancements

The project team anticipates a relatively high rate of community activity, content and source submissions, posting of documentation and open collaboration. With large open collaboration and integration of content from multiple parties, it is necessary to identify and track bugs, features and enhancements. The project team encourages all participants to fully utilize the ticketing system for identification, submission, and tracking against all content (web site, documentation, tools, source code, etc.) maintained by this project.


## Project Team

The SCAP on Apple project is led by [Shawn Geddis](https://github.com/DewSecGitHub), Apple Enterprise Security Consulting Engineer with participation from NIST and NSA representatives.
