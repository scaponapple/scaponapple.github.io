    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="propertyText">This guide is designed to provide comprehensive discussion of
  security-relevant configuration settings for Apple iOS 6. Providing system
  administrators with such information enables them to securely configure
  systems under their control in a variety of network roles. This guide also
  provides policy makers with a comprehensive catalog of settings, from which
  security baselines can be constructed. The XCCDF format enables granular
  selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL and
  OCIL content provides an automated checking capability. Transformations of
  this document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
  providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy
  objectives.</div>
    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <div class="legal">
      <p>Do not attempt to implement any of the settings in
  this guide without first testing them in a non-operational environment. The
  creators of this guidance assume no responsibility whatsoever for its use by
  other parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied, about its
  quality, reliability, or any other characteristic.</p>

      <h2><a name="introduction"/>1 Introduction</h2>
      <div class="propertyText"><b xmlns="">Purpose.</b> This document provides security-related usage and configuration
recommendations for Apple iOS devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
This document does not constitute government policy, nor is it an endorsement
of any particular platform; its purpose is solely to provide security guidance.
This guide may outline procedures required to implement or secure certain
features, but it is also not a general-purpose configuration manual.
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
<b xmlns="">Audience.</b>  This guide is primarily intended for network/system
administrators deploying Apple’s iOS devices or supporting their integration
into enterprise networks.  Some information relevant to IT decision makers and
users of the devices is also included. Readers are assumed to possess basic
network and system administration skills for Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows
systems, and they should have some familiarity with Apple’s documentation and
user interface conventions.
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
<b xmlns="">Scope.</b> Apple's mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad, are
prominent examples of a new generation of mobile devices that combine into a
single device the capabilities of a cellular phone, laptop computer, portable
music player, camera, audio recorder, GPS receiver and other electronics. The
capabilities of such devices are considerable but, as with any information
system, also pose some security risks. Design features can seriously mitigate
some risks, but others must be considered as part of a careful, holistic risk
decision that also respects the capabilities enabled by such devices.
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
Security guidance for mobile devices must cut across many previously discrete
boundaries between technologies. For example, scrupulous deployment of an
iPhone includes consideration not just the settings on the device itself, but
those of the Wi-Fi networks to which it will connect, the VPNs through which it
will tunnel, and the servers from which it will receive its configuration. This
guide provides recommendations for the settings on an iOS device itself, as
well as closely-related information for the network and configuration resources
upon which deployment of iOS devices depends.

          <div class="propertyText"> Data transmitted over a network, whether via wire or wirelessly,
is susceptible to passive monitoring. Whenever practical mechanisms exist for
encrypting this data-in-transit, they should be applied. Even if data is
expected to be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be
encrypted if possible. Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is
particularly important. iOS’s support for SSL, WPA2, and IPsec protocols
demonstrates its capabilities, when such features are activated, to adhere to
this principle. </div>

          <div class="propertyText"> Data on mobile devices is particularly susceptible to compromise
due to loss of physical control. Whenever practical solutions exist, they
should be employed to protect this data. The Data Protection API on iOS devices
is used by some applications, and demonstrates the devices’ capability to
provide such protection. Drawing on applications which use this capability (and
ensuring that internally-developed enterprise applications also use it), and
setting an appropriately complex passcode, follow this principle.

          <div class="propertyText"> The easiest and simplest way to avoid the vulnerabilities in a
particular piece of software is to avoid installing the software altogether.
Hundreds of thousands of 3rd-party applications, or “apps,” written by
thousands of different developers are available for iOS devices. These
developers may have willfully or accidentally introduced vulnerabilities. For
some environments, a particular app may fulfill a mission-critical need. In
other cases an app might needlessly introduce additional risk to the system.
Certain risk scenarios may call for minimizing apps. BYOD scenarios, on the
other hand, generally imply the consideration and acceptance of such risks.

          <div class="propertyText"> Security features should be effectively used to improve a
system’s resistance to attacks. These features can improve a system’s
robustness against attack for only the cost of a little effort spent doing
configuration. For example, iOS’s enforcement of code signing of apps provides
assurance of integrity both during installation and at runtime. Disabling this
feature through the use of “jailbreaking” tools provided by the hacker
community significantly decreases an iOS device’s resistance to attack.

The more privileges (or capabilities) that a user has, the more opportunities
he or she will have to enable the compromise of the system (and be a victim of
such a compromise). For example, a configuration profile can disallow use of
the Safari web browser and the camera. Disabling the camera prevents a
malicious or careless user from photographing sensitive areas, while disabling
Safari helps ensure the user is protected from any web-based attacks (albeit at
significant loss of capability). Similarly, it is possible to restrict the
installation of third party apps, and this may be the right balance between
security and functionality for some environments. </div>

        <div class="propertyText"> Understanding the risks – and available mitigations – involved in
the deployment of smartphone platforms such as iOS provides a background for
certain risk decisions. An attacker who has compromised any mobile device, and
can remotely maintain control of that device, can use this access to gather a
great deal of information about the user of the device and his or her
environment. As described by NIST Special Publication 800-124, the
consequences of such attacks include: 
<ul xmlns=""><li>collecting audio (“hot-microphone” eavesdropping)</li><li>using the cameras</li><li>geolocation of the device (and presumably the user)</li><li>collecting all data, including credentials stored on the device or accessed by it</li><li>acting as the user on any network to which the device later connects.</li></ul>
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
The following table describes risks (with attack vector) along with applicable
mitigations that are either built into the iOS platform or can be employed by
administrators or users. The following table is provided as a summary for risk
decision makers - and to motivate administrators to apply mitigations whenever
practical. <i xmlns="">It should not be used to draw comparisons between iOS and other
platforms.</i>
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
<table xmlns=""><tr><th>Risk</th><th>Mitigation</th></tr><tr><td>Data Compromise due to Lost Device (still reachable over any network interface --- cellular or WiFi) </td><td>Enabling a Passcode provides protection for Apps that leverage the Data Protection API, such as Apple's Mail app and 3rd party apps, as well as for credential storage in Keychains. Using the latest hardware currently prevents usage of public Jailbreak tools to access other data on a lost device.  Activating a remote wipe can be performed via ActiveSync, MDM, or iCloud.  Find My iPhone or other geolocation could permit the lost device to be located. </td></tr><tr><td>Data Compromise due to Lost Device (not reachable over any network interface)</td><td>Enabling a Passcode encrypts some data on the device.  Using the latest hardware currently prevents usage of public Jailbreak tools to access other data on a lost device.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Compromise due to Casual Access Attempt</td><td>Enabling a Passcode prevents a casual snoop from accessing the device. Provide user training to stress importance of physical control at all times.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Compromise via Host Computer Backup/Sync </td><td>Ensure proper hygiene and configuration of systems used for backup/sync.
This may entail enterprise rollout of iTunes, to ensure protection of backup
data. Train users not to connect their device to any untrusted
computers/devices and provide additional AC outlet chargers. Encrypting iOS
device backups in iTunes can mitigate data loss if the host computer is later
compromised or lost. </td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation of Device via Malicious app </td><td>The Sandboxing feature prevents apps from carrying out certain malicious
activities. The App Store's app vetting process provides accountability for
developers, which discourages creation of malicious apps. Disabling the App
Store, or permitting only installation of Enterprise-created Apps, further
mitigates any threat from 3rd party app developers (at significant cost to
capability).</td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation of Device via Malicious WiFi Network </td><td>Apply software updates. Provide user training on connecting only to trusted
networks. Provide user training to encourage use of the VPN.  </td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation of Device via Bluetooth Communications</td><td>Apply software
updates.  Monitor compliance with MDM software. iOS only implements a small
subset of the available BlueTooth profiles, which decreases its likelihood to
contain vulnerabilities that would give rise to exploitation.</td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation of Device via Cellular Network (e.g. SMS/MMS, baseband communications)</td><td>Apply software updates.  Monitor compliance with MDM software.  Provide user training to ensure awareness during travel.</td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation of Device via Malicious Email or Web Page</td><td>Apply software updates, with particular vigilance after public release of jailbreak tools. Monitor compliance with MDM software.</td></tr></table>

      <div class="propertyText">This chapter presents information about creating and deploying
settings to iOS devices, which are generally contained in configuration
profiles. Configuration profiles are simply XML files that conform to Apple's
XML DTD and the plist format. Additional information is available at

        <h2><a name="nature_of_configuration_profiles"/>2.1 Nature of Configuration Profiles</h2>
        <div class="propertyText">Understand that a user who controls an iOS device can opt to erase
the device, which erases all data from the device including any configuration
profiles. Understand also that users can typically append further restrictive
settings, as well as services, onto the device, even in the presence of a
configuration profile.  Configuration Profile settings enforcement on the iOS
devices are cumulative indicating that they can further restrict existing
settings when applied.
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
iOS configuration profiles specify a collection of settings that can control
some security-relevant behavior of an iOS device, but are not designed to
provide an enterprise with total, arbitrary control over the user's device.
<br xmlns=""/>
<br xmlns=""/>
A "carrot and stick" approach can be employed to avoid tempting users to remove
a configuration profile (either directly or via device reset). Bind "carrots"
(such as credentials needed for enterprise access) to "sticks" (such as a
passcode policy) in a single configuration profile. Removing a configuration
profile implies that credentials necessary for accessing enterprise services
(such as VPN certificates or e-mail accounts) would also be lost, and thus deny
the user such services. Also in this case, MDM software would become unable to
query the device and the enterprise would be alerted as to the device's
unmanaged status.</div>

automate the deployment of configuration profiles and carry out the operational
management of devices. Configuration profiles can also be provided via secure
web-based services. Configuration profiles can also be created using Apple’s
iPhone Configuration Utility ("iPCU"), but it does not provide mechanisms for
automated deployment or reporting. iPCU provides a convenient means of
surveying the settings which can be deployed to devices, although there is no
guarantee that a particular MDM product will support all settings.

          <div class="propertyText"> Mobile device management software may also include features that
are not part of the supported Apple MDM API: 
<ul xmlns=""><li>"Jailbreak detection” can
determine if a user has chosen to jailbreak his or her device, which is a
useful feature for enterprises who monitor compliance. However, it does not
provide high assurance that a device has not been maliciously jailbroken by a
sophisticated attacker. The situation is analogous to “root detection” on
another mobile platform. It is also analogous to the historical and difficult
problem of rootkit detection on desktop or server operating systems. In all
these cases, the operating system itself becomes compromised. Since it alone
operates at the most privileged levels, there are limits to the extent to which
any add-on software can "ask a liar if he is lying."
<br/>
<br/>
The system’s cryptographically-verified boot process, runtime enforcement of
code signatures, app sandboxing mechanism, controlled software distribution
model via "app stores", and rapid software update capability very strongly
address the problem of jailbreak-based attacks by themselves. Using add-on
software to query for signs of jailbreak may provide an additional layer of
defense. </li><br/><br/><li>"Secure containers" can provide data-at-rest protection and data-in-transit
protection. These are typically software libraries included by 3rd party apps,
which then make use of their functionality instead of that provided by the
system’s software libraries. These "containers" (which are really just apps)
can be useful if the system’s capable, built-in mechanisms which already
provide these features do not meet particular requirements. Note, however, that
they cannot protect their contents against privileged code running on the
device, such as would result from a sophisticated, malicious jailbreak attack
during system operation.
<br/>
<br/>
They should also <i>not be confused</i> with the Sandboxing feature of
the iOS kernel as described in [Blazakis]. Rather, the Sandboxing feature
strongly addresses the problem of malicious or co-opted apps trying to perform
undesirable activities on the system (such as elevating their privileges) in
the first place. Sandboxing constitutes a significant obstacle to attackers,
but it does not allow apps to (rather inconceivably) protect themselves if the
underlying operating system is compromised. App sandboxing may serve as a means
of jailbreak detection as discussed above, in that an app which can access
beyond its Sandbox may infer that it is running on a compromised device.

Over-the-air deployment that is authenticated and encrypted requires the
support of enterprise infrastructure, such as directory services, an enterprise

</li><li><i>Installation</i> of an encrypted, authenticated configuration profile onto the device.

</div>
          <div class="propertyText"> It is possible to distribute configuration profiles to individual

generally be taught not to have confidence about the origin of email
attachments or SMS messages.

        <div class="propertyText"> The remarkable attention paid to passcode quality requirements
represents misplaced priorities in the current network environment, as
passcodes do not protect against many contemporary threats. However, setting a
passcode enables cryptographic features that can protect data on the device if
it is lost, stolen or temporarily out of possession. Hardware and software
cryptographic features of iOS devices – not present on typical desktop or
server systems – provide significant protections against the password-guessing
threat when the passcode feature is enabled. Furthermore, iOS devices are
likely to store only a single user’s credentials, while complex passcode
policies are designed to protect against the compromise of large numbers of
credentials when they are stored on a single system that becomes compromised
(such as a directory server). Onerous passcode policies may also drive users to
attempt to subvert the settings. For these reasons, IT decision makers should
understand that onerous passcode policies on iOS devices provide little value
(in the best case), and may end up being counterproductive.

The following publicly-available research provides rationale for these recommendations:

          <div class="propertyText"> Enabling a passcode activates the Data Protection feature of iOS.
The Data Protection feature encrypts items with a key whose availability
depends on entry of the passcode. Currently, the following items are protected:
<ul xmlns=""><li><b>Email messages</b> stored by the built-in Mail app </li><li><b>Inactive Apps’ Screenshots</b> displayed at app re-launch to create
impression of “instant resume” </li><li><b>Some Keychain Items</b> such as email passwords and iTunes backup password </li><li><b>Data stored by third-party apps</b> which use the Data Protection API </li></ul>
</div>
          <div class="propertyText"> In fact, the rest of the files on the device are encrypted, but
they are still available to an attacker who can get privileged code to execute
on the device. This is because the encryption key for these files is available
even without the passcode (unlike the files above).

This was possible for a time using publicly-available tools which provide the ability
to execute privileged code on any device in physical possession. Examples of
these tools include jailbreak software such as <i xmlns="">evasi0n</i> from the evad3rs
and <i xmlns="">redsn0w</i> from The iPhone Dev Team. These applications leverage a
collection of exploits and other jailbreak utilities including <i xmlns="">limera1n</i>
by George Hotz (geohot).

Note also that even if privileged code can be run by an attacker on a lost or
stolen iPhone, a password-guessing attack against the protected files must be
executed on the device itself. This is because the key which encrypts the items
listed above is derived from the passcode as well as a key that is bound to the
hardware of the device (and not considered extricable from it).
